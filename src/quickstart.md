# Quickstart

Using Grillon is quite simple, we will consider you are running it as part of your testing process. But you can also use it as a regular dependency.

## Configuration

Before we begin, let's create a `tests/` directory at the root of the project. Create a file there named `create_posts.rs`.

Add `grillon` to your development dependencies with `tokio`, as we need a runtime to run async functions in our test environement.

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
grillon = "0.4.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros"] }
```

Our example will test the `/posts` endpoint of `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`. We will send a json payload and we will assert that our resource is correctly created with an acceptable response time (< 500 ms). Depending on your location, feel free to tweak the response time value (in milliseconds).

## Write the test

Create a new `create_posts.rs` file in `tests` and copy/paste the following example:

```rust,noplaypen
use grillon::{dsl::*, dsl::http::*, json, Grillon, StatusCode, Result};
use grillon::header::{HeaderValue, CONTENT_LENGTH, CONTENT_TYPE};

#[tokio::test]
async fn create_posts_monitoring() -> Result<()> {
    Grillon::new("http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com")?
        .post("posts")
        .payload(json!({
            "title": "foo",
            "body": "bar",
            "userId": 1
        }))
        .assert()
        .await
        .status(is_success())
        .status(is(201))
        .response_time(is_less_than(500))
        .json_body(is(json!({
            "id": 101,
        })))
        .headers(contains(vec![
        (
            CONTENT_TYPE,
            HeaderValue::from_static("application/json; charset=utf-8"),
        ),
        (
            CONTENT_LENGTH, HeaderValue::from_static("15")
        )]))
        .assert_fn(|assert| {
            assert!(!assert.headers.is_empty());
            assert!(assert.status == StatusCode::CREATED);
            assert!(assert.json.is_some());

            // only displayed with --nocapture option
            println!("Json response : {:#?}", assert.json);
        });

    Ok(())
}
```

## Run the test

```bash
cargo test --test create_posts -- --nocapture
```

You should see similar output:

```bash
cargo test --test create_posts -- --nocapture
  Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.14s
    Running tests/create_posts.rs (target/debug/deps/create_posts-26c6ab07b039dabd)

running 1 test
Json response : Some(
    Object {
        "id": Number(101),
    },
)
test create_posts_monitoring ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.38s
```

Well done! You've written your first HTTP API test!

In this example, we performed assertions on:

- the status code
- the response time
- the headers
- the json body (note that partial json body isn't yet supported, see [#25](https://github.com/owlduty/grillon/issues/25))

We also added custom assertions and function calls with `assert_fn`. So if you have specific needs, you can manipulate `assert` and add your own logic!

## Next steps

This was a basic example, this book will contain more in-depth content about Grillon such as reusing request builders, some examples on how to organize your tests as well as test guides. You will also find documentation on the different functionalities by protocol, how to configure your logs and how to integrate Grillon into your pipelines.

But this book is a work in progress, so please consider it a TODO comment ðŸ˜‰.
